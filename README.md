# Business-Analytics--KNIME
First project using KNIME in my Business Analytics course.
This project involved the importation of an excel file (Height of Male and Female 2022) into the KNIME platform using the excel reader node. 
We were then required to filter the columns to remove the Ranks.
After that, we were supposed to join the 2 sheets (cm and ft) into one using the joiner node. We then filetered the country Ghana and did a summation of the hieghts ib cm.
